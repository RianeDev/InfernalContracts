Game Rules


Energy: 3 per turn unless special circumstances dictate otherwise. 
Demons: Souls 
Undead: Blight 
Angel: Light


Turns: 3 energy per turn. You can spend that energy however you want per turn. No 
limit to the number of cards, only limited by energy. When you end your turn, you discard all cards in your hand.
* Life Crystal: Each game begins with your life crystal in the very back of your play field. It has 20 life per game (not per combat, per game) and if it reaches 0, this run ends.
* Each player can have a maximum of 6 creatures out at any one time. If any creatures are on the field, creature attacks will attack those first, meaning any creatures present protects your Life Crystal.
* Damage is NOT carried over in the event of overflow unless by special circumstance. (I.E. a creature with 5 life that takes 10 damage does not transfer 5 damage to the Life Crystal).


Spells CANNOT BE CAST on the life crystal directly unless by special circumstance or card ability.
* Cards will have an effect. Like with Keves, when he's played, you get 3 knife cards that do a thing.


Some cards may have no effect at all.


Your Champion DOES NOT count towards your maximum number of creatures. Creature Cards are neither exhausted or in the discard pile until they die, including your champion. When a creature dies, including your champion, they are added to the top of your discard pile like any other card and are shuffled back in like any other card. The only exception to this is your Champion costs 1 more energy each time they are summoned to bring back.


Armor is just extra health. 


Power cards are permanent per combat. 


All cards, unless otherwise notated through special circumstances, are discarded on use. Please see individual cards for cost/effect. 


Banish cards are exiled from that combat for the remainder of combat and are not shuffled back into the draw pile pile. Discard pile and banish pile are separate. Banish cards stay banished except in special circumstances. 


Refresh cards are returned to your hand after they are played. Refresh 1 means it refreshes 1 time, refresh 2 refreshes twice, etc. 


X+ cards indicate a variable. For example a card might say “Does X+1 where X is the number of energy used” or “Does X+1 damage where X is the number of the same card used”. 


Preserve cards are not discarded from your hand when you end your turn. 


Max Hand size: 7




Return cards are cards that are put back onto the top of your draw pile when certain effects are met. Return 1 means it returns once, return 2 means it returns twice, etc.
